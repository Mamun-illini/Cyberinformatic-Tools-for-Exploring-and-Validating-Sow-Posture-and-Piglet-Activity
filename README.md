# FACT-AI-Cyberinformatic-Tools-for-Exploring-and-Validating-Sow-Posture-and-Piglet-Activity
**Summary:** This project, funded by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), aims to develop and deploy cyberinfrastructure tools for the automatic identification and analysis of sow posture and piglet activity. Our primary goals include reducing pre-weaning mortality caused by sows crushing their piglets and understanding the maternal behaviors associated with piglet survival.

**Objectives:**
1.	Data Curation: Establish a cloud-based server to curate sow and piglet behavioral data, including sequential imagery and production records.
2.	Machine Learning Models: Develop and evaluate machine learning models for automatically identifying and quantifying time-series behavioral phenotypes from image data.
3.	Mothering Ability Index (MAI): Create an index to classify a sow's ability to successfully raise a litter based on identified behavioral phenotypes and production records.

**Key Accomplishments:**
•	Developed statistical model for factors that affect pre-weaning mortality and machine learning algorithm to predict.
• Developed deep learning models for automatic sow posture and piglet activity classification using the YOLOv8 algorithm (Both depth image and RGB image).
•	Achieved high accuracy in detecting and classifying sow postures and nursing events.
•	Preliminary results show correlations between behavioral phenotypes and pre-weaning mortality rates.
