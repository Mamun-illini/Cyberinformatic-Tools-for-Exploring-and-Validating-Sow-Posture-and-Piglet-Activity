# Segmentation Model Predict and Tracking on Video Data

This project demonstrates the use of a segmentation model to predict and track sows and piglets within a farrowing crate. The folder includes two videos showcasing the model's performance.

**Videos:**

Video 1: Demonstrates the initial predictions of sows and piglets using segmentation model.

Video 2: Shows continuous tracking and segmentation, highlighting the model's ability to handle movement and interaction within the crate.

These videos provide a visual understanding of the model's capabilities in a real-world setting, making it easier to observe and evaluate its performance.
